BEAVRS Input File Generator
===========================

The BEAVRS script has been redesigned to be more user-friendly and modular. With
the new script it should be much easier to extract single elements of the
geometry (e.g., single assemblies and pins) as well as make modifications to
different parts of the geometry.

The old script is replaced with python module `beavrs`, and a main builder class
that contains all elements of the model that can be manipulated in python before
outputing input files.

The script has been built to use OpenCG (formerly
[OpenCG](https://github.com/mit-crpg/opencg)) and the OpenMC python API.
This should enable future changes to OpenMC input file format to be easily
accomodated for, and allow for easy creation of inputs for different codes (e.g.
Serpent, MCNP) once OpenCG compatibility modules are created for them.

Installation
------------

This package can be installed with distutils via:

```bash
python setup.py install --user
```

The dependencies are not officially released yet, but they are easy to obtain
for CRPG group members.  In the near future these will be part of official
publicly-available releases.

To satisfy the OpenCG dependency:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mit-crpg/OpenCG.git
cd OpenCG
python setup.py install --user
```

Usage
-----

Once the module is installed, it can be constructed in python:

```python
from beavrs.builder import BEAVRS

model = BEAVRS()

model.write_openmc_geometry()
model.write_openmc_materials()
model.write_openmc_plots()
model.write_openmc_settings()

```

For convenience, a script `make_beavrs.py` is also provided to build the model.
